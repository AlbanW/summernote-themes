### summernote-themes
Themes for Summernote WYSIWYG Editor

This repository contains a set of themes mainly for Summernote Lite version.

Most of the themes are easily added by swapping out the CSS File in place of the original supplied by the Summernote team.

In this repository we supply a minified, unminified, version using Summernote's Icons, a version using LibreICON Icons (black and colour embedded).

To use the themes simply reference the stylesheet in place of Summernote's stylesheet. Rather than adding another stylesheet to your pages, we though it better to have a complete replacement, which should also minimise conflicts.

#### Default Theme
